    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Have you ever tried making homemade Pho? ♡</p>
    <p>
      This traditional Vietnamese noodle soup has been a favorite of mine for
      decades. I have yet to travel to Vietnam to officially try pho in its
      country of origin (hopefully someday soon!), but I have ordered it
      countless times in Vietnamese restaurants in the States and here in
      Barcelona. And this cozy, fresh, and deeply flavorful soup has a way of
      hitting the spot every single time. It will always be one of my favorite
      soups to order out. But recently, I’ve been experimenting with different
      ways to make pho at home, and as it turns out, it’s easier than I
      expected!
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, a winning pho recipe all boils down (quite literally) to the
      quality of its broth. In traditional Vietnamese cooking, pho broth is
      typically simmered for many hours in order to create that rich, layered,
      cozy blend of flavors that we all know and love. But while the beef stock
      base is traditionally made 100% from scratch — a method that is
      incomparably delicious, yet requires bringing home lots of beef bones and
      extra veggies plus an extra 2-3 hours of simmering — I’ve tested out a
      shortcut method using store-bought beef stock as the base for this broth
      instead. And while it wouldn’t be considered authentic, it turns out that
      this shortcut method still tastes wonderfully rich and delicious and it
      can be ready to go in as little as 45 minutes. Once simmered together with
      charred onion and ginger, a generous handful of warming spices, a hint of
      sweetener, plus a heaping pile of fresh herbs as garnish, I’m telling you,
      this homemade pho recipe is one that you are going to want to make again
      and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you have been wanting to try making your own homemade pho, I highly
      recommend giving this recipe a try!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Stake</strong></p>
      </li>
      <p>
        Pho bo is traditionally made with thinly sliced steak that is cooked in
        the simmering broth in each individual serving bowl. In order to very
        thinly slice the steak, I recommend popping the steak in the freezer for
        about 45-60 minutes, then slicing it against the grain as thinly as
        possible. (Alternately, you can ask the butcher to thinly slice your
        steak for you, or add pre-cooked steak to your soup.)
      </p>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Thin rice noodles</strong></p>
      </li>
      <p>
        Pho is traditionally made with thin rice noodles. In order to prevent
        the noodles from overcooking in the broth, it’s traditional to cook pho
        noodles separately on their own. Then the noodles will be added to each
        individual serving bowl, followed by the protein, hot broth and
        toppings.
      </p>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Pho broth</strong></p>
      </li>
      <p>
        Again, this “shortcut” version of pho broth would not be considered
        authentic. But it is a delicious and faster alternative to making it
        100% from scratch, and it uses the following elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Fresh onions and gingers</strong></p>
        </li>
        <p>
          Which we will briefly cook in a skillet (or you can pop them under the
          broiler in your oven) until charred, in order to add that classic
          smoky flavor to the broth.
        </p>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Beef stock</strong></p>
        </li>
        <p>
          In order to save the extra hours required to cook beef stock from
          scratch, I’ve written this recipe using (good quality) store-bought
          stock as a shortcut.
        </p>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Spices</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There are 5 important spices in pho broth — star anise, whole
            cloves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and coriander seeds. I
            really recommend using the whole (not ground) spices if possible,
            which we will briefly toast to bring out extra flavor.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Fish sauce</strong></p>
        </li>
        <p>It’s traditional to add just a little splash to the broth.</p>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Sweeterners</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Seasalt</strong></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Toppings, toppings, toppings</strong></p>
      </li>
      <p>
        his is one soup recipe where the toppings are not optional. Rather, the
        toppings are the stars of the soup! Feel free to pick and choose your
        favorites

    <h2>How to make Pho soup</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Prep the protein.</strong> In order to slice the beef, chicken
          or pork as thinly as possible, I recommend popping the meat in the
          freezer for at least 30-45 minutes to chill. Then use a sharp knife to
          thinly slice the meat before adding it to the soup.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Make the broth.</strong> Meanwhile, as the meat is chilling,
          char the onion and ginger (either in a skillet or under the broiler).
          Meanwhile, briefly toast the spices in a large stockpot. Then add in
          the onion, ginger, and broth. Cover and let everything simmer together
          for at least 30 minutes so that all of those flavors can meld. Strain
          out and discard all of the onions, ginger and spices. Then stir in the
          remaining ingredients and season with salt.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Prep the noodles.</strong> Meanwhile, as your broth is
          simmering, go ahead and cook the noodles al dente according to the
          package instructions. Drain in a strainer, then toss briefly with cold
          water to prevent the noodles from continuing to cook, and set aside.
          (I also recommend tossing the noodles with a drizzle of oil — such as
          sesame oil — to prevent them from sticking.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Assemble.</strong> Once everything is ready to go, add a
          handful of noodles to each individual serving bowl, topped with your
          desired protein. Then ladle the simmering hot broth into the serving
          bowls, being sure to submerge the meat so that it will get cooked. Top
          with lots and lots of garnishes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Serve.</strong> And serve warm, encouraging everyone to stir
          the garnishes into the soup so that they can flavor the broth, also
          adding in additional extra sauces if desired.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
